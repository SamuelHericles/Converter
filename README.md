# Converter
  A simple converter of the coins and length
# Description
  Develop a currency and unit length converter that follows the following operating phases:
  1. Initially, the system should allow the choice between currency converter and units of length;
  2. If you choose currency converter, you must allow the choice between Dollar, Euro and Real, enabling all conversion combinations between them. The quote may be fixed,
   considering the quotation of the day of development;
  3. If you choose a unit of length converter, you must choose between kilometer, meter, centimeter, millimeter, mile, foot and inch, enabling all
  the conversion combinations between them;
  4. After showing the result, the system must allow new operations in the converter until the user selects or enters a specific command to exit, which
  needs to be clear during program execution.
# Comments:
  1. The entire system should have exception handling that displays alert messages if the user enters invalid characters for the conversions;
  2. The system can be graphic or via command / terminal, provided that the user always know which converter is active
